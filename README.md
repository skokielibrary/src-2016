## Overview

This is the repo for the Summer Reading landing page. You can view the page at [https://skokielibrary.info/summerreading/](https://skokielibrary.info/summerreading/).

## Setup

To work on this locally, clone the repository and run `npm install`. After that run, 'gulp' to launch Browser Sync and build the page.

## Form template

Due to the requirement this year to have an online submission form for content, we created a custom Django template for the form and confirmation page (template lives with the website repo).

Because the website usess https and Evanced doesn't, we uploaded the css and font files to the static files directory of the website.
